The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is an open-source tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. 
With minimal configuration, the AWS CLI enables you to start running commands that implement functionality equivalent to that provided by the browser-based 
AWS Management Console from the command prompt in your terminal program.

To install the AWS CLI, run the following commands.

$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

To Confirm the installation we can validate with the following command.

$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.15.59 Python/3.11.8 Linux/6.1.91-99.172.amzn2023.x86_64 exe/x86_64.amzn.2023

To configure OUR AWS account to AWS CLI use the below command.
